The process begins with the start event where a customer brings a defective computer. The customer service representative (CSR) then checks the defect. After identifying the defect, the CSR provides a repair cost calculation to the customer. 

At this point, an exclusive gateway is reached where the customer decides whether the cost is acceptable or not. If the cost is not acceptable, the customer takes the computer home and the process ends. 

If the cost is acceptable, the process moves to a parallel gateway where two tasks are performed simultaneously. One task involves checking and repairing the hardware, while the other involves checking and configuring the software. 

Once both tasks are completed, the system functionality is tested. If no errors are detected, the repair is finished and the process ends. If an error is detected, the process loops back to the exclusive gateway where the cost is reassessed. 

This loop continues until no errors are detected in the system functionality test, at which point the repair is declared finished and the process ends.
