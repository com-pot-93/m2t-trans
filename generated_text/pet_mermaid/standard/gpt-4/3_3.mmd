The process begins with the start event. The claims officer registers the claim, which is the first task. After the claim is registered, the claims officer examines the claim, which is the second task. Following the examination, the process reaches an exclusive gateway. 

If the claim passes through the gateway, the claims officer writes a settlement recommendation. This recommendation is then checked by a senior claims officer. After checking the recommendation, the senior claims officer marks the claim. The process then reaches another exclusive gateway. 

If the claim is marked as 'ok', the claim handling process proceeds. If the claim is marked as 'nok', the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back. This leads back to the first exclusive gateway. 

If the claim handling process proceeds, it reaches the end event. If the recommendation is sent back, the claims officer writes a new settlement recommendation, and the process repeats from there.
