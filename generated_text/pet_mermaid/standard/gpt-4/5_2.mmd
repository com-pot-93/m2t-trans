The process begins with the start event where an employee submits a vacation request. This request is then registered as a requirement. Following this, the supervisor receives the request. The supervisor then has the task of approving the request. After the supervisor's approval, there are two possible outcomes. If the request is not approved, the application is returned. If the request is approved, a notification is generated. In the case of approval, the HR department completes the respective management procedures. Regardless of the outcome, the process ends with the end event.
