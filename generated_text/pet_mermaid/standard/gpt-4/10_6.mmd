The process begins with the start event. The MSPN sends a dismissal, which is then reviewed by the MSPO. After the review, there are two possible outcomes. If the MSPO rejects the dismissal, the process goes back to the exclusive gateway. If the MSPO confirms the dismissal, the process also goes back to the exclusive gateway. The process ends with the end event.
