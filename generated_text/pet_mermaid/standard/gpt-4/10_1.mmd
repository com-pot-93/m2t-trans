The process begins with the start event. The first task is that MPON sends the dismissal. After this, the task moves to MPOO who reviews the dismissal. Following this review, there is an exclusive gateway. If MPOO opposes the dismissal, the process moves to the task of MPOO opposing the dismissal. If MPOO confirms the dismissal, the process moves to the task of MPOO confirming the dismissal. Both these paths then converge at another exclusive gateway. The process then ends with the end event.
