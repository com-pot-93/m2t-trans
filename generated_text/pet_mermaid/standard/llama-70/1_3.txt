A guest calls and places an order. The manager takes down the order and submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The manager also gives the order to the sommelier and assigns it to the waiter. The kitchen and the sommelier work on their respective tasks, while the waiter readies the cart. Once the kitchen and sommelier have finished their tasks, the waiter delivers the cart to the guest. The waiter then returns to the room service station and may wait to do the billing. If there are no other orders, the waiter debits the guest account and the process ends. If there is another order, the waiter goes back to preparing the next cart.
