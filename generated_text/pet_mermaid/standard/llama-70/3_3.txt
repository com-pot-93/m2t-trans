A claims officer registers a claim and examines it. Then, a senior claims officer checks the recommendation and marks the claim. If the mark is "ok," the claim handling process proceeds. If the mark is "nok," the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back to the claims officer. The claims officer then re-examines the claim and updates the recommendation. Finally, the senior claims officer checks the updated recommendation and marks the claim again. If the mark is still "nok," the process goes back to the previous step. If the mark is now "ok," the claim handling process proceeds to the final step.
