A customer brings a defective computer to the Customer Service Department. The Computer Repair Specialist (CRS) checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. The customer can choose to accept or decline the repair cost. If accepted, the CRS repairs the computer. First, the hardware is checked, and any issues are fixed. Next, the software is checked, and any problems are configured. Finally, the system's functionality is tested. If no errors are detected, the repair is considered finished. If an error is detected, the process goes back to the previous step. Once the repair is finished, the computer is handed back to the customer, and the process ends.
