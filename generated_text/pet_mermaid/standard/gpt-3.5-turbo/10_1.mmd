The process starts with the "startevent" where MPON sends the dismissal. Then, the task moves to MPOO who reviews the dismissal. After that, there is an exclusive gateway where two paths can be taken. If MPOO opposes the dismissal, the task moves to another task. If MPOO confirms the dismissal, the task moves directly to the next exclusive gateway. From there, if the task goes to the next task, it again reaches an exclusive gateway. Finally, the process ends with the "endevent".
