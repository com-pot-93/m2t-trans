The process starts with an employee submitting a vacation request. The requirement is then registered, and the supervisor receives the request. The supervisor approves the request, and it goes to an exclusive gateway. If the request is not approved, the application is returned. If the request is approved, a notification is generated. From there, the process branches out to two exclusive gateways. One path leads to the HR completing the necessary management procedures, while the other path goes back to the exclusive gateway. Finally, the process ends with an end event.
