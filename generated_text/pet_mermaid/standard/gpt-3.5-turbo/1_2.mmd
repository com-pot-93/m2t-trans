The process starts with the customer bringing a defective computer. The CRS (Customer Service Representative) checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. Then, there is an exclusive gateway where two paths can be taken. If the defect is not acceptable, the customer takes the computer home. If the defect is acceptable, there is another exclusive gateway. From there, the process splits into two parallel paths. One path checks the hardware, repairs it if needed, and then checks the software and configures it. The other path directly checks the software and configures it. Both paths converge at a task where the system functionality is tested. If no errors are detected, the repair is considered finished. If errors are detected, the process goes back to the previous exclusive gateway. Finally, the process ends with the customer receiving the repaired computer.
