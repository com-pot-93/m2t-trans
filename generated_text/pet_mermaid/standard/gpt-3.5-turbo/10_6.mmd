The process starts with a "startevent" where MSPN sends a dismissal. This is followed by a task where MSPO reviews the dismissal. Then, there is an exclusive gateway denoted by "{x}". If MSPO rejects the dismissal, the process moves to a task. If MSPO confirms the dismissal, the process moves to another task. Both paths eventually lead to an exclusive gateway denoted by "{x}". From there, the process either goes to an endevent or returns to a task. Finally, the process ends with an "endevent".
