The process starts with a customer bringing in a defective computer. The Computer Repair Service (CRS) then checks the computer for any issues and calculates the repair cost. If the computer is not accepted, the customer takes it home. Otherwise, the CRS proceeds with repairing the hardware and checking its functionality. Once the repairs are complete, the software is configured, and the system is tested to ensure proper functioning. If no errors are found, the repair is considered finished. However, if an error is detected during testing, the repair is abandoned, and the customer is informed. Finally, the process ends with the completion of the repair and the customer taking their device back.
