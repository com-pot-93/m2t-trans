When a guest calls, the manager takes down their order, creates an order ticket, and passes it on to the kitchen. Meanwhile, the manager also assigns the order to the sommelier who prepares the food and drinks. Afterward, the manager assigns the order to the waiter, who readies the cart and delivers it to the guest's location. Depending on whether there are more orders to be delivered, the waiter may either bill the guest or move on to another task. Once all deliveries are completed, the process comes to an end.
