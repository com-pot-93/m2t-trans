When a claim is registered by a claims officer, they examine it and write a settlement recommendation. A senior claims officer then reviews the recommendation and decides whether to approve or reject it. If approved, the claim handling process can continue; otherwise, the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back for further review. The process ends when the claim is marked as settled or rejected. Along the way, the claims officer may write additional reports or take other actions depending on the outcome of the decision-making process.
