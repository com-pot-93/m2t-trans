An employee submits a vacation request, which is then registered and received by their supervisor. The supervisor then reviews and approves the request, after which HR completes the necessary management procedures. If the request is not approved, the employee will receive a notification and the process ends. If approved, HR generates a notification and completes the relevant procedures. The process concludes once all steps have been completed.
