A process starts with an event called "Start Event". From there, the process moves to a task where MSPN sends a dismissal. After sending the dismissal, the process goes back to another task where MSPO reviews the dismissal. If the review is successful, the process proceeds to an exclusive gateway, where MSPO either accepts or rejects the dismissal. Depending on the outcome, the process flows to different tasks and gates until it reaches the final event called "End Event".
