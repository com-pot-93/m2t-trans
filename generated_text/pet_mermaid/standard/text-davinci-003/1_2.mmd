The process starts when a customer brings a defective computer to the CRS. The CRS then checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. If the customer finds the cost acceptable, the CRS will check the hardware and repair it, configure the software, and test the system functionality. If there are no errors detected, the repair is finished. If there are errors detected, the process will repeat until the repair is finished. Finally, the customer takes the computer home.
