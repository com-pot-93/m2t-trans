The process starts when a customer brings a defective computer. The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. If the customer finds the cost acceptable, the CRS checks the hardware and repairs it, configures the software, and tests the system functionality. If there are no errors, the repair is finished. If an error is detected, the process returns to the CRS.
