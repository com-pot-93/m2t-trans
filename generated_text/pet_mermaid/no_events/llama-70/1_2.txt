When a customer brings a defective computer, the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system checks the defect and hands over the repair cost calculation to the customer. If the customer accepts the cost, the computer is repaired. The repair process includes checking the hardware, repairing any issues found, configuring the software, and testing the system for functionality. Once the repair is complete and no errors are detected, the process ends. However, if an error is detected during the repair process, the exclusive gateway sends the task back to the parallel gateway, which then checks the hardware and software again before sending it back to the exclusive gateway. Finally, when the repair is completed successfully, the process ends with the "End Event."
