The claims officer registers a claim and examines it. Then, the claims officer writes a settlement recommendation and sends it to the senior claims officer for review. The senior claims officer checks the recommendation and either approves it (marking the claim as "ok") or sends it back to the claims officer for revision (marking the claim as "nok"). If approved, the claim handling process proceeds. otherwise, the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back to the claims officer, who makes revisions and resubmits it. Once the claim is marked as "ok", the process ends.
