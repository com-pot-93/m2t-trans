When a guest calls, the manager takes down the order and submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The manager also gives the order to the sommelier and assigns it to the waiter. The kitchen and the sommelier work on their respective tasks in parallel, while the waiter readies the cart. Once the kitchen and sommelier have finished their tasks, they notify the waiter, who then delivers the food to the guest. After delivering the food, the waiter returns to the room service station and waits for further instructions. If there are no other orders, the waiter debits the guest's account and closes the transaction. Otherwise, the waiter waits for another order and repeats the process. When all orders have been fulfilled, the process ends.
