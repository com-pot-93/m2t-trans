The process starts with an event where MPON sends the dismissal. Then, MPOO reviews the dismissal. After that, there is a decision point represented by an exclusive gateway. If MPOO opposes the dismissal, the process goes to a task. If MPOO confirms the dismissal, it also goes to a task. Both paths converge at another exclusive gateway. From there, the process either goes to an end event or returns to a task. Finally, the process ends at an end event.
