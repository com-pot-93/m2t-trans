A claims officer starts by registering a claim. Then, they examine the claim. Depending on the outcome, they either write a settlement recommendation or send the claim back to a senior claims officer for review. If the recommendation is approved, the claim handling process proceeds. Otherwise, the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back. Finally, the process ends.
