A customer brings a defective computer. The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. If the defect is not acceptable, the customer takes the computer home. If the defect is acceptable, the hardware is checked and repaired. Then, the software is checked and configured. The system functionality is tested, and if no errors are detected, the repair is finished. If errors are detected, the process goes back to checking the software. Finally, the customer receives the repaired computer.
