A guest calls to place an order. The manager takes down the order and submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The manager also gives the order to the sommelier and assigns it to the waiter. The kitchen and sommelier start working on their tasks while the waiter readies the cart. Once the kitchen and sommelier are done, the waiter delivers the cart and returns to the room service station. The waiter may wait to do the billing or debit the guest's account. If there are more orders, the process starts again. Otherwise, the process ends.
