The process starts with an event where MSPN sends a dismissal. Then, MSPO reviews the dismissal. After that, there is a decision point represented by an exclusive gateway. If MSPO rejects the dismissal, the process goes to a task. If MSPO confirms the dismissal, it also goes to a task. Both paths eventually lead to another decision point represented by an exclusive gateway. From there, the process either goes to an end event or returns to a task. Finally, the process ends at an end event.
