An employee submits a vacation request (step 1), which is then registered (step 2). The supervisor receives the request (step 3) and decides whether to approve it (step 4). If the request is not approved, the process ends (step 5); otherwise, the HR generates a notification (step 6) and completes the necessary management procedures (step 9). Once these procedures are complete, the process ends (step 10).
