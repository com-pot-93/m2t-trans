The process begins when a customer brings a defective computer. The customer service representative (CRS) checks the defect and then provides the customer with a repair cost calculation. 

At this point, if the cost is not acceptable to the customer, they take the computer home and the process ends. 

If the cost is acceptable, the process continues with a parallel check of the hardware and software. The hardware is checked and repaired, and the software is checked and configured. 

After both the hardware and software have been addressed, the system functionality is tested. If no errors are detected, the repair is finished and the process ends. 

However, if an error is detected during the system functionality test, the process returns to the point where the cost was deemed acceptable by the customer, and the hardware and software checks are repeated. 

This cycle continues until no errors are detected in the system functionality test, at which point the repair is finished and the process ends.
