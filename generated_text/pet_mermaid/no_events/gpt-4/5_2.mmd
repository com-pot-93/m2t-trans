The process begins with an employee submitting a vacation request. This request is then registered. Following registration, the supervisor receives the request. The supervisor then has the responsibility to approve the request. If the request is not approved, the application is returned. If the request is approved, a notification is generated. Following the generation of the notification, HR completes the respective management procedures. The process concludes after these procedures are completed.
