The process starts with an employee submitting a vacation request. The supervisor reviews the request and then approves it. The request is then registered, and a notification is generated. The HR department completes the management procedures, and the process ends.

Here's a more detailed description of the process:

    Employee submits vacation request.
    Supervisor reviews request.
    Supervisor approves request.
    Request is registered.
    Notification is generated.
    HR completes management procedures.
    Process ends.

Note: There are two possible paths after step 4:

    Segment 1: Return application (not approved)
    Segment 2: Generate notification (approved)
