The process starts with the MPON sending the dismissal to the MPOO. The MPOO reviews the dismissal and then either opposes or confirms it. If the MPOO opposes the dismissal, the process goes to meg_1. If the MPOO confirms the dismissal, the process also goes to meg_1. The process ends at end_1.

Here's a more detailed description of the process:

    MPON sends the dismissal to the MPOO.
    MPOO reviews the dismissal.
    MPOO either opposes or confirms the dismissal.
    If MPOO opposes the dismissal, the process goes to meg_1.
    If MPOO confirms the dismissal, the process also goes to meg_1.
    The process ends at end_1.

Note: There are two possible paths after step 3:

    Segment 1: Oppose
    Segment 2: Confirm
