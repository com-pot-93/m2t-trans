The process starts with MSPN sending a dismissal. MSPO reviews the dismissal and then either rejects or confirms it. If MSPO rejects the dismissal, the process goes to meg_1. If MSPO confirms the dismissal, the process also goes to meg_1. The process ends at end_1.

Here's a more detailed description of the process:

    MSPN sends a dismissal.
    MSPO reviews the dismissal.
    MSPO either rejects or confirms the dismissal.
    If MSPO rejects the dismissal, the process goes to meg_1.
    If MSPO confirms the dismissal, the process also goes to meg_1.
    The process ends at end_1.

Note: There are two possible paths after step 3:

    Segment 1: Rejection
    Segment 2: Confirmation
