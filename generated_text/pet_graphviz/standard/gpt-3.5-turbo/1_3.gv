The process starts when a guest calls for room service. The room-service manager takes down the order and submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The manager also gives an order to the sommelier and assigns the order to the waiter. The kitchen and the sommelier start working on their tasks while the waiter readies the cart. The waiter then delivers the cart to the guest's room and returns to the room service station. At this point, there are two possibilities: if there is another order, the waiter may wait to do the billing; if there are no other orders, the waiter debits the guest's account. Finally, the process ends when the billing is completed or the guest's account is debited.
