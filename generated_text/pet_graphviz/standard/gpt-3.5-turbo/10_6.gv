The process starts with an initial step. Then, the MSPN sends a dismissal for review to the MSPO. The MSPO reviews the dismissal and either rejects or confirms it. If the dismissal is rejected, it goes through a segment called "seg_1" and then goes to the "meg_1" step. If the dismissal is confirmed, it also goes through the "seg_1" step and then proceeds to the "meg_1" step. Finally, the process ends.
