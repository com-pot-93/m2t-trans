The process starts with the claims officer registering the claim. Then, the claims officer examines the claim. If everything is in order, the claim is passed to the "meg" step, where the claims officer writes a settlement recommendation. The recommendation is then checked by a senior claims officer. If the recommendation is approved, the senior claims officer marks the claim and it proceeds to the claim handling process. However, if the recommendation is not approved, it is sent back to the "meg" step for further review. Finally, once the claim handling process is completed, the process ends.
