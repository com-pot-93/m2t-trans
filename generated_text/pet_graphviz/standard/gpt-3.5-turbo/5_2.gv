The process starts with an employee submitting a vacation request. The requirement is then registered, and the supervisor reviews the request. If the supervisor approves the request, a notification is generated. If the request is not approved, the application is returned. In both cases, the HR department completes the necessary management procedures. Finally, the process ends.
