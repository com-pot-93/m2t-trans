The process begins at the start point. The MSPN sends a dismissal, which is then reviewed by the MSPO. After the review, the process reaches a decision point, represented by "X". If the dismissal is rejected, the process moves to another decision point, also represented by "X". If the dismissal is confirmed, it also moves to the same decision point. From this point, the process ends.
