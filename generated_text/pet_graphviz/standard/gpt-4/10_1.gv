The process begins at the start point. The MPON sends the dismissal to the MPOO. After receiving the dismissal, the MPOO reviews it. Following the review, there are two possible outcomes. If the MPOO opposes the dismissal of the MPON, it moves to the next stage. If the MPOO confirms the dismissal of the MPON, it also moves to the next stage. Regardless of the decision, the process ends at the end point.
