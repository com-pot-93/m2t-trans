The process begins when an employee submits a vacation request. This request is then registered. Following this, the supervisor reviews the request and makes a decision. If the supervisor approves the request, a notification is generated. This notification then leads to the HR department completing the necessary management procedures. If the supervisor does not approve the request, the application is returned. Both the completion of the HR procedures and the return of the application lead to the end of the process.
