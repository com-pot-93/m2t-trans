The process starts with an initial step, where a task called "Start 1" (labelled as "") is encountered. This is followed by three sub-steps:

    INQ transmits the transaction data request (labelled as "Task 1").
    IP checks the request (labelled as "Task 2").
    IP answers the question (labelled as "Task 3").

These tasks are connected in a linear sequence, with arrows indicating the order in which they should be performed. The process ends at the final step, labeled as "End 1".
