The process starts with a customer bringing a defective computer to a Computer Repair Service (CRS). The CRS checks the computer for any issues and provides an estimate of the repair costs if necessary. If the issue is minor, the customer can take the computer home directly. Otherwise, the CRS will provide a detailed repair plan, including the estimated cost of repairs.
Next, the customer must approve the repair plan before the work begins. Once approved, the CRS performs the necessary repairs on the computer's hardware. After that, they configure the software and check it for proper functioning. Finally, they test the entire system to ensure it works correctly and detect any errors. If no errors are found, the process ends successfully. However, if an error is detected during testing, the process continues to the next step, where the CRS will attempt to fix the issue.
