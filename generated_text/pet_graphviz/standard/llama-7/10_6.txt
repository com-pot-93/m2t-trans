The process starts at node "start_1," where an event or action occurs that triggers a series of subsequent events and actions. The first connection is from "start_1" to "MSPN sends dismissal," indicating that MSPN (Management Support Process Network) sends some sort of notification or request related to dismissal.

From there, the process flows to "MSPN reviews dismissal," which suggests that MSPN reviews the notification or request received earlier. This leads to two possible outcomes: either "seg_1" (which represents a segment or stage in the process), or "rejection." If "seg_1" is selected, the process moves to "MSPO rejects dismissal," indicating that MSPO (Managing Director's Office) rejects the proposal for some reason. Otherwise, if "rejection" is chosen, the process ends at "meg_1" (which likely refers to the final destination or outcome of the process).

Finally, the process concludes with "meg_1" connected to "end_1," suggesting that the overall process has reached its conclusion.
