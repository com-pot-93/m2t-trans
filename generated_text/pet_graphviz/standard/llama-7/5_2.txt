Process Overview: Vacation Request Management

The process begins when an employee submits a vacation request (Step 1). Then, the supervisor reviews the request (Step 2). If approved, the request is registered (Step 3), and the employee receives notice of the decision (Step 4). If rejected, the process ends (Step 5).

Steps 3-5 are optional and depend on the outcome of Step 2. If the request is approved, the process continues to Step 6, where the HR department completes any remaining management procedures. Finally, the process concludes with the employee receiving their approved vacation time (Step 7).
