The process starts with a claims officer registering a claim. The claims officer then examines the claim and either writes a settlement recommendation or sends it back to the claims officer. If the recommendation is written, it is then checked by a senior claims officer who marks the claim. If the recommendation is sent back, the process starts again. If the recommendation is accepted, the claim handling process proceeds and ends with the senior claims officer sending the recommendation back.
