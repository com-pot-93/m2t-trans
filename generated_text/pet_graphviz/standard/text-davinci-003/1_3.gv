The process starts when a guest calls for room service. The room-service manager takes down the order and submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The manager then gives the order to the sommelier and assigns it to the waiter. The kitchen and the sommelier do their tasks while the waiter readies the cart. The waiter then delivers the cart and returns to the room service station. The waiter may wait to do the billing if there is another order, or debit the guest account if there are no other orders. The process ends when the waiter completes the billing or debiting.
