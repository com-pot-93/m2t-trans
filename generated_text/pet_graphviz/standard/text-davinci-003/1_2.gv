This process starts when a customer brings a defective computer to the CRS. The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. If the customer finds the cost acceptable, the CRS will check the hardware and software, repair the hardware, configure the software, and test the system functionality. If no errors are detected, the repair is finished. If errors are detected, the process will go back to the CRS. If the customer does not find the cost acceptable, they will take the computer home.
