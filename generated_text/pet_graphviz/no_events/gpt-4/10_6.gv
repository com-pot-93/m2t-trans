The process begins with the MSPN sending a dismissal. After this, the MSPO reviews the dismissal. Following the review, there are two possible outcomes. If the dismissal is rejected by the MSPO, the process moves to the next stage. If the dismissal is confirmed by the MSPO, the process also moves to the next stage. Regardless of the outcome, the process ends after this stage.
