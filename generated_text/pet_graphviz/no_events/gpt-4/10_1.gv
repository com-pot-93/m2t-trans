The process begins with MPON sending the dismissal to the MPOO. After receiving the dismissal, the MPOO reviews it. Following the review, there are two possible outcomes. If the MPOO opposes the dismissal of MPON, it will proceed to the next step. Alternatively, if the MPOO confirms the dismissal of the MPON, it will also proceed to the next step. Regardless of the outcome, the process ends after this step.
