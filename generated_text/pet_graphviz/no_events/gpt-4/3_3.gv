The process begins with the claims officer registering the claim. After the claim is registered, the claims officer examines the claim. Following the examination, the claims officer writes a settlement recommendation. This recommendation is then checked by the senior claims officer. 

After checking the recommendation, the senior claims officer marks the claim. At this point, if the claim is marked as "OK", the claim handling process proceeds and the process ends. 

However, if the claim is marked as "Not OK", the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back to the claims officer. The claims officer then rewrites the settlement recommendation and the process repeats until the claim is marked as "OK" by the senior claims officer. Once the claim is marked as "OK", the claim handling process proceeds and the process ends.
