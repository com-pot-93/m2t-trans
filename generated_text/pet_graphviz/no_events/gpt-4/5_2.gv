The process begins with the employee submitting a vacation request. This request is then registered. Following this, the supervisor reviews the request. If the supervisor approves the request, a notification is generated. If the supervisor does not approve the request, the application is returned. In the case of approval, the HR completes the management procedures. Whether the application is returned or the HR completes the procedures, the process ends thereafter.
