A guest calls the room-service manager to place an order. The manager takes down the order and submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The manager also gives an order to the sommelier and assigns the order to the waiter. The kitchen and sommelier start working on their tasks while the waiter readies the cart. Once ready, the waiter delivers the cart to the guest's room and then returns to the room service station. At this point, the waiter may wait to do the billing if there is another order, or the waiter debits the guest's account if there are no more orders. Finally, the process ends.
