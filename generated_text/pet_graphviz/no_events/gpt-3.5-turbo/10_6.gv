The process starts with an initial step. Then, a dismissal is sent by MSPN for review by MSPO. MSPO reviews the dismissal and depending on the outcome, it either rejects or confirms the dismissal. If the dismissal is rejected, it goes through a segment called "seg_1" and then reaches a step called "meg_1". If the dismissal is confirmed, it also goes through "seg_1" and reaches the same step "meg_1". Finally, the process ends.
