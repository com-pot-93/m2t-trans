The process starts with the registration of a claim by the claims officer. The officer then examines the claim and proceeds to a step called "X". After this step, the officer writes a settlement recommendation. The recommendation is then checked by a senior claims officer. If the recommendation is approved, the senior officer marks the claim and the process continues. However, if the recommendation is not approved, it is sent back to the step "X". Finally, the claim handling process proceeds and reaches its end.
