The process starts with an action where MPON sends a dismissal to the MPOO. The MPOO then reviews the dismissal. After the review, there is a decision point represented by a diamond shape. At this point, the MPOO can either oppose the dismissal of MPON or confirm it. If the MPOO opposes the dismissal, another decision point is reached, represented by another diamond shape. From here, the process can either end or continue to another action. If the MPOO confirms the dismissal, the process also continues to the same action. Finally, the process ends with an action where the result is confirmed.
