A customer brings a defective computer to the CRS. The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. If the defect is not acceptable, the customer takes the computer home. If the defect is acceptable, the computer goes to the next step. The computer is checked for hardware and software issues. If there are hardware issues, the computer goes to the repair hardware step. If there are software issues, the computer goes to the configure software step. After the hardware and software checks, the computer goes to the test system functionality step. If no errors are detected, the repair is finished and the computer goes to the end. If errors are detected, the computer goes back to the previous step.
