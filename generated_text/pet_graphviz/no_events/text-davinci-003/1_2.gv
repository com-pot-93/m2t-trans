Customer brings a defective computer to the CRS, who checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. If the customer finds the cost acceptable, the CRS will check the hardware and software, repair the hardware if necessary, configure the software, and test the system functionality. If no errors are detected, the repair is finished. If errors are detected, the customer can take the computer home and the process starts again.
