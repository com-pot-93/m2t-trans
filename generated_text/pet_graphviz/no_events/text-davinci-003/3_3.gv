The process starts with a claims officer registering a claim. The claims officer then examines the claim and writes a settlement recommendation. The senior claims officer checks the recommendation and marks the claim. If the claim handling process proceeds, it ends. If not, the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back to the claims officer.
