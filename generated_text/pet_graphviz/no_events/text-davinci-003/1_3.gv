Guest calls the room-service manager, who takes down the order and submits an order ticket to the kitchen. The manager also gives an order to the sommelier and assigns the order to the waiter. The kitchen and the sommelier do their tasks while the waiter readies the cart. The waiter then delivers the cart and returns to the room service station. The waiter may wait to do the billing or debit the guest account, depending on if there are any other orders. Finally, the process is complete.
