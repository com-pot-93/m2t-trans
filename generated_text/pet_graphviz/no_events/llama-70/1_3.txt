The room service process starts when a guest calls the room service department. The room service manager takes down the order and submits it to the kitchen. The manager also gives the order to the sommelier and assigns it to the waiter. The waiter prepares the cart while the kitchen and sommelier work on their respective tasks. Once ready, the waiter delivers the cart to the guest room. After delivery, the waiter returns to the room service station where they may wait for another order or debit the guest account. If there are no other orders, the waiter debits the guest account and ends the process. If there is another order, the waiter waits for further instructions. Eventually, the process ends when the last order is completed and the guest's account is debited.
