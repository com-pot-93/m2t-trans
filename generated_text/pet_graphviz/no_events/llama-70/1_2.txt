The customer brings a defective computer to the CRS, which checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation. The system then passes through two parallel paths: one for acceptable repairs and another for unacceptable ones. For acceptable repairs, the customer takes the computer home and performs megatrends 1 and 2. Then, it goes through a series of steps - spg 1, check hardware, repair hardware, configure software, check software, mpg 1, test system functionality, seg 2, and finally, repair is finished with no errors detected or an error is detected and sent back to meg 2.

For unacceptable repairs, the system follows a different path from seg 1 to customer take computer home, then to meg 1 and meg 2 before merging with the acceptable path at spg 1. Finally, it goes through the same sequence of steps as in the acceptable path until reaching repair is finished.
