The claims officer registers a claim and examines it. They then write a settlement recommendation and send it to the senior claims officer for review. The senior claims officer checks the recommendation and marks the claim accordingly. If the mark is "OK," the claim handling process proceeds, and the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back to the claims officer. If the mark is "Not OK," the claim handling process does not proceed, and the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back to the claims officer. The process ends when the claim is settled or rejected.
