The process starts with an event called "start_1," which is represented by a circle shape in the diagram. From here, there are several events and transitions that occur:

    The first transition is from "start_1" to "MPON sends the dismissal to the MPOO." This is represented by a rectangle shape in the diagram.
    After sending the dismissal, the MPOO reviews it, as indicated by a transition from "MPON sends the dismissal to the MPOO" to "MPOO reviews the dismissal."
    Next, the MPOO makes a decision regarding the dismissal, either opposing or confirming it. There are two transitions for each option: "MPOO opposes the dismissal of MPON" and "MPOO confirms the dismissal of the MPON." These transitions lead back to "MPOO reviews the dismissal."
    Once the MPOO has made its decision, the process moves on to the next step, where the megastore receives the news. This is represented by a transition from "MPOO confirms the dismissal of the MPON" to "meg_1."
    Finally, the process ends at "end_1."

In summary, the process described by the GraphViz model involves the following steps:

    An event called "start_1" occurs, representing the beginning of the process.
    The MPOO receives a dismissal request from MPON.
    The MPOO reviews the dismissal request.
    The MPOO decides whether to oppose or confirm the dismissal.
    If the MPOO confirms the dismissal, the megastore receives the news.
    The process ends at "end_1."
