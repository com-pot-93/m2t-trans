A guest makes a call to the room service, and the room service manager takes down their order. The manager then submits an order ticket to the kitchen, giving instructions to the sommelier. Once the order is ready, the waiter picks it up and delivers it to the guest's room. After delivering the order, the waiter returns to the room service station and may wait to perform the billing. If there is another order, the waiter debits the guest's account before returning to the room service station. Otherwise, the waiter completes the delivery and the process ends.
