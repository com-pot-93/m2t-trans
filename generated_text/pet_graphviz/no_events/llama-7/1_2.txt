A customer brings their defective computer to a CRS for repair. The CRS checks the computer and provides an estimate of the repair costs. Depending on whether the repair is acceptable or not, the customer either takes the computer home or moves on to the next stage. In the next stages, the computer undergoes various repairs, including hardware and software configuration, checking of both hardware and software, and testing of the system functionality. If no errors are detected during any of these stages, the repair is considered complete, and the computer is returned to the customer. However, if an error is detected during one of the stages, the repair is incomplete, and the customer is informed of the issue. Finally, once all stages have been completed successfully, the repair is deemed finished, and the computer is returned to the customer.
