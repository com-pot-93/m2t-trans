The process begins when a claims officer registers a new claim. They then examine the claim and write a settlement recommendation. A senior claims officer reviews the recommendation and either approves or rejects it. If approved, the claim is marked as settled and the process continues. If rejected, the senior claims officer sends the recommendation back to the claims officer for further review. The process ends when the claim is marked as settled or rejected. Along the way, the process may encounter obstacles (represented by diamonds) that require additional examination and decision-making.
