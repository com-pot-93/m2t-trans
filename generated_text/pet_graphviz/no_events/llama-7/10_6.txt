The process starts with an event called "Start 1," which is followed by MSN sending a dismissal request. Then, MSPO reviews the dismissal request and either accepts or rejects it. If rejected, the process flows to a gateway called "Segment 1," where the decision is confirmed. From there, the process ends at an event called "End 1." Along the way, there are several other events and gateways that handle different aspects of the process, including a review of the dismissal request, rejection of the request, confirmation of the decision, and communication between MSN and MSPO.
